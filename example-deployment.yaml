# This deployment manifest serves as an example of what a gMSA enabled workload would look like when deployed
# onto a Windows cluster with the Rancher Plugin gMSA solution configured. In all likely-hood, this workload cannot
# be deployed as-is without properly configuring the cluster with the required namespaces, service accounts, GMSACredentialSpecs
# and associated gMSA charts. The intent of this manifest is to show how automatically enabling gMSA within workloads requires only
# minimal changes to existing deployment manifests.
